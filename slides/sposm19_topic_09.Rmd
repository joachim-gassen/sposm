## Assignments

- If you want to receive credits (6 ECTS) for this course you need to
  hand in three individual and one group assignment on time.
  
- Individual assignment: Coding sprints (three week period, scattered throughout 
  the term, 5 in total)
  
- Group projects: One larger real-life task. The project needs to generate an
  asset for the open science community.
  
- Groups should consist of not more than five people. Please try to
  self-coordinate groups based on skills and domain interest. Let me know when 
  you need help. Groups should be formed by the end of next week, preferably 
  today.

- While the coding sprints will be determined and introduced by me, the group
  assignments will be negotiated with each group. I have some ideas but am 
  open for suggestions.

  

## Your first sprint assignment

\footnotesize

- Provide code that produces a GIF documenting something interesting based on 
  World Bank data. Communicating the increasing income gap between Africa and the 
  rest of the world is an option but you can also choose a different topic.

- An example:
  https://twitter.com/DLeonhardt/status/1181004566088814594

- Data: `worldbank` dataset from `ExPanDaR` package or 
  https://data.worldbank.org
  
- Your solution has to contain code and documentation so that it can
  be reproduced in our development environment. Data should _not_ be included
  but the code should pull it from publicly available resources.
  
- Deadline for submission: Monday, Oct 28, 9am. Please only commit locally prior
  to the deadline (maybe in a separate branch?) and submit by email.

- After the deadline, feel free to push your code to your remote
  fork for everybody to enjoy.
